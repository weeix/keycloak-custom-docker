# Feature Specification: Mobile-friendly green & sky-blue Keycloak login theme

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-login`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a login theme for Keycloak that looks similar to the attached image but change the main colours to green and sky blue. It should display properly on a mobile phone."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a site visitor accessing the authentication page, I want the Keycloak login screen to present a welcoming, professional layout styled with green and sky-blue tones so that it feels aligned with the brand aesthetic while remaining easy to use on desktop and mobile devices.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the Keycloak login page on a desktop browser, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a two-section layout echoing the provided reference design with green and sky-blue gradients, branded text on the left, and login form elements on the right.
2. **Given** a user opens the login page on a mobile device in portrait orientation, **When** the page loads, **Then** the layout adapts responsively (stacked content, readable typography, accessible tap targets) while preserving the green and sky-blue theme.
3. **Given** a user reviews the login form, **When** they look for supporting options, **Then** they can see links for "Forgot password?" and a "Remember me" control styled consistently with the theme.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when viewport width is very narrow (<320px) and how do content sections collapse while maintaining readability?
- How does the layout behave on very wide desktop screens to avoid excessive whitespace or distorted gradients?
- How are error or validation messages styled so they remain legible against the green/sky-blue palette?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The login theme MUST present a hero-style panel conveying welcome messaging that visually resembles the provided reference structure while adopting green and sky-blue as primary colors.
- **FR-002**: The theme MUST apply the green and sky-blue palette consistently across backgrounds, buttons, form fields, and accent elements without reducing text contrast or readability.
- **FR-003**: The layout MUST remain responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints, ensuring that all interactive elements fit within view without horizontal scrolling.
- **FR-004**: All standard Keycloak login controls (username, password, primary action button, remember-me, forgot-password link) MUST be styled to match the theme while preserving accessibility (e.g., focus states, color contrast).
- **FR-005**: The theme MUST support localized or longer text strings without breaking the layout or overlapping visual elements.
- **FR-006**: The theme MUST maintain visual fidelity on both light and dark device settings without unintended color shifts.
- **FR-007**: The theme MUST ensure that imagery or gradient assets load efficiently to avoid slowing the login experience on mobile networks.
- **FR-008**: The theme MUST document recommended logo or branding asset dimensions to keep the layout balanced.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Theme Assets**: Includes color palette definitions, typography guidelines, background gradients, and optional decorative graphics required to reproduce the visual style.
- **Responsive Layout Breakpoints**: Describes key viewport ranges (mobile, tablet, desktop) with associated layout behaviors to ensure consistent rendering.
