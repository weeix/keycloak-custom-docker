# Keycloak Custom Docker Constitution

## Core Principles

### Strategic Incrementalism
Plan ambitiously but deliver in small, reviewable slices. Every change MUST ship behind a
failing-to-passing test cycle and include a rollback strategy. Large initiatives are to be
split into milestones that can land independently without blocking contributors.

### Radical Simplicity
Prefer the simplest approach that satisfies requirements. Reject unnecessary abstractions,
third-party dependencies, or configuration unless justified in the plan. Complexity MUST be
documented with clear rationale and an exit strategy.

### Best-Practice Discipline
Align implementation with well-documented industry and upstream Keycloak best practices.
Reference official docs or community standards when making architectural decisions. Deviations
MUST be explained in design docs and validated with automated tests.

### Open Contribution
Optimize the repository for new contributors: keep documentation current, automate setup, and
maintain clear task breakdowns. Reviewers MUST flag unclear instructions or opaque code paths
so they can be improved before merge.

### Container-First Delivery
Docker or Podman images are the primary delivery vehicle. All tooling, testing, and deployment
workflows MUST function via containers by default. Non-container paths are optional and must
not break the containerized experience.

## Execution Standards
- Maintain a reproducible container build (Dockerfile/Containerfile) with automated image
  verification tests.
- Ensure CI pipelines validate container builds, smoke tests, and linting before release.
- Capture key operational knowledge (environment variables, volumes, networking) in the README
  and quickstart docs.
- Treat security patches and upstream Keycloak updates as priority maintenance tasks.

## Workflow Expectations
- Begin each feature with research and planning documents that cite relevant best practices.
- Keep tasks scoped to achieve test-first progress within a day of effort.
- Require pair review or asynchronous walkthroughs for non-trivial changes to uphold simplicity
  and contributor clarity.
- Update onboarding or contributor docs whenever processes change.

## Governance
- This constitution supersedes conflicting guidance. Amendments require consensus in review and
  MUST include version bumps, rationale, and template sync confirmation.
- Compliance is verified during plan reviews and pull-request checks. Violations block merge
  until resolved or formally waived with documented mitigation.
- Versioning follows MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH semantics based on scope of change. Ratification and
  amendment dates are recorded per update.
